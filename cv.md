# About me

### Some words about myself... I've graduated Belarusian State Technological University in 2021, went through the army and worked as a designer in the chemical industry for one year. I start thinking about programming 2 years ago but start learning right after army. Now I've almost a year of experiance in web-programming and I realy enjoy this profession. What you really need to know about me is that I always reach my goal, and right now that goal is to be a good IT specialist. My hobbies are sport, travelling, computer games and the new one - writting code.
