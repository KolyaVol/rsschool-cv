					Some words about myself... I've graduated Belarusian State
					Technological University in 2021, went through the army and worked as
					a designer in the chemical industry for one year. I start thinking
					about programming 2 years ago but start learning right after army. Now
					I've almost a year of experiance in web-programming and I realy enjoy
					this profession. What you really need to know about me is that I
					always reach my goal, and right now that goal is to be a good IT
					specialist. My hobbies are sport, travelling, computer games and the
					new one - writting code.
